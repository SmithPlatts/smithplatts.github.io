*Michael Gartenberg* writes a great piece over on Macworld about [Post-PC vs Sans-PC](http://www.macworld.com/article/159077/2011/04/gartenberg.html "Macworld - Why &quot;post PC&quot; doesn't mean &quot;sans PC&quot;").

He has a great opinion on the matter, and explains it succinctly:

  > ...most commentators have completely missed the point… and likely failed Latin in High School as well.
  > 
  > In fact, *post PC* means *after PC*, a new generation of products that build on the PC. What it doesn’t mean is *sans PC*, that is, *without PC*. The personal computer will no doubt be with us for a very long time… but that doesn’t mean we’re not in the post-PC world.

So get on over to Macworld and have a read; and may you then, like me, be better informed about the term "Post-PC"
