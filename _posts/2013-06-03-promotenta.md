    PromoteNTA is little command line utility that can be used to “promote” a Notification Tray application state
</div>

If you have the Windows (XP/7/8) Notification Tray (the one in the bottom right corner) configured with default settings, it will hide any application that isn’t active; i.e. telling (notifying) you about something. There are two other states an application can be promoted to, *always hide* or *always show*. Windows doesn’t provide a way to programatically “promote” the state of an application tray but instead only allows a user to set this using the User Interface.

PromoteNTA is a way for software developers or system admins to centrally promote an application state for any/all user/s.

If you are interested in finding out more, [click through here](/cli-tools/promotenta/ "PromoteNTA – Promote a Notification Tray Application") to get access to the utility and the [developer resource](/cli-tools/promotenta/devresource/ "Assembly.PromotNTA – Promote a Notification Tray Application [Developer Resource]")!
