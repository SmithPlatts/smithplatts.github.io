title: G'Day and Welcome!
sticky: true

This blog will cover such topics as: motorbikes/motorcycling, software development, tech stuff, music/bass guitar gear and stuff, personal tid-bits, and whatever else I feel like writing (complaining/ranting) about.

Each post has Twitter and Email sharing links. I do most of my discussions on Twitter so it makes sense to direct any blog-based discussions there too. Email contact is available via the [colophon](/colophon/) page.

So, welcome to my blog and enjoy your stay!
