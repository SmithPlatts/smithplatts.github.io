*I start the prayer*; <br />
already a feeling of disconnect ...

*I pray the first decade*; <br />
why this feeling of hollowness to my words and intentions?

*I pray a second decade*; <br />
for you God, and for myself, I try to mean every word I say ...

*I pray the third decade*; <br />
the yawning starts, I struggle to focus ...

*I pray the fourth decade*; <br />
God, give me strength to give my all to you ...

*I pray the fifth decade*; <br />
I love you Lord, I really do!
