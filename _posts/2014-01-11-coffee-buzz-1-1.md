[Coffee Buzz](/coffeebuzz/) 1.1 is here! <br />
It has been a fun holiday working on some different personal projects, and this was one of them :)

Since initially creating **Coffee Buzz**, I have learnt a lot \[more] about `Object Orientated Programming` and the language `C#`; so for this release there is quite a lot of refactoring, performance improvements, better memory management and a few little features/changes.

The main features additions/changes are:

- Added the ability to disable balloon tips
  - `Shift`+`Click` the Icon to access the new setting
- Added menu header to easily identify current version
- Added menu aware click-behaviour of the *Notification Tray* icon left-click
- Altered left-click behaviour when clicking the *Notification Tray* icon to allow for double click before presenting the menu; right-click behaviour unchanged
- Added error log saving and notification for easier support in the rare case of issue
- Rearranged menu item placement for the addition of the header and moved the ***About*** menu item to above ***Quit***

You can get the new version [here](/coffeebuzz/#download); and of course, any issues please don't hesitate to get in touch :)
