[Coffee Buzz](/coffeebuzz/) 1.2 is out!

Just a sniff of an update really:

- Changed behaviour if you try to run more than one copy of Coffee Buzz on the same computer when logged in as the same user
  - Before, each time you tried to run a new copy when one was running, the new copy would just exit leaving the running version untouched. Now, it will tell the running version to Buzz! the machine :D
- Fixed a consistency problem with the menu aware click-behaviour of the Notification Tray icon left-click

So, [the new version is right here if you want it](/coffeebuzz/#download); as always, any issues please get in touch!
