I hate starting things and then not finishing them.<br />
Some things work great when treated as an always incomplete project; but, for the most part, I hate the practice.

I managed to not only start, but complete two personal projects: [Coffee Buzz](/coffeebuzz/ "Coffee Buzz – Give Your Computer a Buzz!") and [PromoteNTA](/cli-tools/promotenta/ "PromoteNTA – Promote a Notification Tray Application"). This was an amazing feeling to complete and *release* them!

When developing them, I signed up for an account with [Assembla](http://www.assembla.com/) and created a private SVN[^SVN] repository so that I can commit to and track changes and progress. I was using the commit messages to keep track of items to-do; sadly this wasn't ideal.

I have recently upgraded the account to include ticketing features. This now allows me to create tasks against the different little projects that I am committing so that I can easily see what is left to do and how close to release I am.

With these new features in Assembla active, I have embarked on:

- a refinement release of [`Coffee Buzz`](/coffeebuzz/ "Coffee Buzz – Give Your Computer a Buzz!")
- a new CLi tool called `EnumInstalledApp`
- *finally* releasing my `Codeless Language Module` for [KiXtart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiXtart "Wikipedia Definition for KiXtart") support in [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/ "Product page for BBEdit")/[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ "Product page for TextWrangler")

Hopefully, by setting up the ticketing support, this blog post and other factors, it may help keep me on track and complete these projects!

Time will tell ... ;P

[^SVN]: There are many different types of version control; I use [SVN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion "Wikipedia Definition for SVN") as I like the centralized model and find it very powerful. I have also been looking into [Mercurial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial "Wikipedia Definition for Mercurial") but haven't set aside the time to tinker yet.
