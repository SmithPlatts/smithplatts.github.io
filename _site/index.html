            <span class="post-meta">Apr 27, 2014</span>
            <article class="excerpt">
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/SmithPlatts">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://alpha.app.net/SmithPlatts">Alpha</a>, I am @SmithPlatts. <br />
My GitHub, <abbr title="Mercurial">HG</abbr>, and <abbr title="Subversion">SVN</abbr> usernames and/or repositories are called SmithPlatts.<br />
Heck, even my author name on my old blog was @SmithPlatts.</p>

<p>So, I have created a new logo to reflect my personal and online presence:</p>

<div class="showcase center no-border">
    <img src="/assets/images/logos/sp_logo_small.png" />
</div>

<p>I have converted it to many different sizes and it scales very well. The original is 1000 x 1000 <em>px</em>, but I have scaled it down to 16 x 16 <em>px</em>, i.e. for a low resolution icon, and it still looks good!</p>

<p>Now, whenever I need a logo/image that warrants a less personal touch, I will use this new one. I will also be incorporating it into things I develop where I do not have a custom icon/logo.</p>

<p>I have also been contemplating a new blog.</p>

<p>When I first created this blog, I had no idea of what I wanted to use it for; no purpose. It was a place I could just jot down ideas, thoughts, rants, <em>etc</em>.</p>

<p>But alas, I could not connect with its purpose. I found its premise to be an obstacle as I required too much focus to post anything, and I would lose interest or would find the idea of writing a post too energy consuming.</p>

<p>So, I have been contemplating creating a new blog. One that is primarily focused on code and software development, but not restricted to it. Since going down this path of software development, I have really felt that I have found my path, my calling. I love coding. So what better way to focus my thoughts then with a blog that actually reflects my passions.</p>

<p>Once I create the new blog, and migrate my posts over, I will let you all know :)</p>

<p>Just a sniff of an update really:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Changed behaviour if you try to run more than one copy of Coffee Buzz on the same computer when logged in as the same user
    <ul>
      <li>Before, each time you tried to run a new copy when one was running, the new copy would just exit leaving the running version untouched. Now, it will tell the running version to Buzz! the machine :D</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a consistency problem with the menu aware click-behaviour of the Notification Tray icon left-click</li>
</ul>

<p>So, <a href="/coffeebuzz/#download">the new version is right here if you want it</a>; as always, any issues please get in touch!</p>

            <article class="excerpt">
                <p>I have been creating a .NET Outlook addin lately and it has been an incredible learning journey. I have had to support 3 generations of Outlook, using the base bottom COM feature/API set (oldest supported; 2007), and have still had to stay within the speed requirements of the latest supported (2013) :-/</p> <p>One thing that perplexed me was how I could hook in, early enough, to the addin load/startup process to subscribe to the <code>AppDomain.UnHandledException</code> and <code>Application.ThreadException</code> event handlers so that I can log exceptions. This is desired because Outlook is so damned efficient that it decides to kill an addin as soon as it exhibits signs of <em>exception</em>al behaviour.</p>

We recently had a [kinda] spur of the moment project kick-in in February with … a very unique individual as our Project Manager. He was a very different personality, and saying that I clashed with him is possibly the biggest understatement that could be made. In the first week he stole my computer chair. Yeah, that’s right, my fucking computer chair. His reason? The chair he got wasn’t comfortable enough and because I’m young, my back can handle it … <br /><br />
