I am a family man. I am married to a wonderful wife whom we share the role of parents to 2 (and a half!) amazing children. We have a lovely house, and I have an awesome job!

Life is pretty great! :D

I:

- am a practicing Catholic
- ride a cruiser motorcycle
- am a programmer/developer/coder
- am a tech enthusiast (freak/geek/nerd/shill; fanboy of many)
- am a general tinkerer
- am a Mr. Fixit
- \[pretend to]Â play bass and acoustic guitar

All that I write about is of my own opinion, and does not reflect the opinion of my employer or anyone who isn't me; unless stated otherwise.

For any type of discussion, I am available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) and via [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Colophon Contact). Regardless of whether you agree or not, please do not insult or abuse my posts or opinion. Keep criticism constructive, and cite your references if highlighting an inaccuracy on my part. I am never afraid to admit to being incorrect, and will update any published subject matter.
 
For those that are so inclined, you can create an issue [against the site](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_reponame }}) or even fork it and submit a pull request.

Don't be stranger!
