All that I write about is of my own opinion, and does not reflect the opinion of my employer or anyone who isn't me; unless stated otherwise.

Heck, you can even [create an issue or fork my blog](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_reponame }}) and make a Pull Request!

Don't be stranger!
